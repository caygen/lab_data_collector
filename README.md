Programs work on Enthought Python and PyVisa
=============================================
Enthought is a python version based on Python 2.7.3 with many useful packages bundled (makes programming much easier!)
PyVisa is the package adding GPIB supporting for Python programs
Visa library, which typically comes with GPIB card driver, is needed for PyVisa to work properly
To test if PyVisa work properly, simply type "import visa" in Python prompt and check errors
